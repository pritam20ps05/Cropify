# Cropify
A solution towards Responsible Production and Consumption for GDSC 2024 Solution Challenge. It focuses on helping organisations or individuals(mostly farmers) in getting a total analysis of a soil sample. 
The analysis currently gives a fertility score, crop suggestions and problem with each nutrient value and tips on how to fix them.

But features will extend to crop recomendation system using geolocation giving recomendations for most profitable crops suitable for a particular location and soil. Also providing information about best practices 
for cultivating those crops and integrating a Chatbot for ease of access.

## Collection of Data
Sample Data is collected through an IoT device making it cheaper and easier to implement than most other methods. Also it will provide us a real-time feed of data which can be used to analyse the paterns 
of nature which will make our model more accurate.
