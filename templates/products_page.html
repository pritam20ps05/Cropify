                        To enhance soil nitrogen content, utilize nitrogen-rich fertilizers,
                        practice crop rotation with nitrogen-fixing plants, employ cover crops,
                        apply well-rotted manure, and consider inoculating seeds with
                        nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Ensure efficient irrigation, monitor pH levels,
                        avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizer use, and adopt conservation tillage
                        practices. Soil testing is crucial for tailored recommendations.

                        Nitrogen is a crucial nutrient in soil, essential for plant growth and key
                        processes like protein synthesis and photosynthesis. It directly impacts
                        crop yield and quality while supporting overall ecosystem health through
                        microbial activity and nutrient cycling. However, proper nitrogen management
                        is vital to prevent environmental issues like water pollution and greenhouse
                        gas emissions.

                    <div class="soln soln-u d-none">
                        To decrease soil nitrogen content, reduce the use of nitrogen-rich
                        fertilizers like urea, adjust crop rotation to limit nitrogen-fixing plants,
                        and introduce non-leguminous crops. Improve drainage, promote soil aeration,
                        and use cover crops to absorb nitrogen. Consider phytoremediation with
                        plants that accumulate nitrogen and monitor soil conditions for effective
                        adjustments.
